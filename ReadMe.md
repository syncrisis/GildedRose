Mob Programming Assignment Checklist/ReadMe

Tarek Ajjour, Nathaniel Hedman, Damian Kilday, Alec Moeser, Wesley Rolnick (Mob Programming 3)


In Canvas, join a Mob Programming group with the members of your mob programming team from Sunday’s on-campus
class. You will all receive the same grade for this assignment.

We are Mob Programming 3


Create a public GitHub repository for your mob. Submit the URL of your repo as the solution to this assignment.

https://github.com/syncrisis/GildedRose


Identify at least one solution for remote pair- and mob programming. What tools will you use to
enable excellent f2f-like collaboration? Strive to reproduce the mobbing we experienced during our
on-campus weekend. Document your solution in your repo’s README.

WebEx, Github


Complete the Gilded Rose refactoring kata with your mob programming team.
- Add your Gilded Rose code to your repo.
See repo


- Mob with your teammates to add unit tests until it is safe to refactor the legacy code. To
demonstrate that you worked as a mob, capture video of your session. Upload your video to YouTube
or Vimeo. Here's an example. Document the URL of your video in your repo's README file.

- Aim for excellent code coverage of the production code; ignore code coverage of the test code.
Some of the on-campus mobs achieved >90% code coverage before they began refactoring. Take a screenshot
of your IDE or code coverage tool showing your project's code coverage. Include the screenshot in your
git repo as a file named code-coverage.png.

TO BE ADDED


- Show that all your unit tests pass. Take a screen shot of the JUnit tests in your IDE, showing the list
of all unit tests and their results. Or copy the console output of your JUnit tests into a text file. Include
the screen shot or text file in your git repo. Name the file test-results.png or test-results.txt.




- Refactor the Gilded Rose production code, removing as many code smells as possible, refactoring for
clean code. Your refactored Gilded Rose production code should be short and concise. Commit your refactored
code to your repo.



- Add the new feature. Use TDD. Your test method(s) for the new inventory item, Conjured items, must start
with the word “conjured”. You have at least one test method for Conjured items, and it proves that Conjured
items degrade twice as fast as ordinary items. All tests pass.
